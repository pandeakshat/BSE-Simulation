One timestep is not one (market) second but is equal to a fraction of a second. The exact fraction is determined by the number of traders (e.g. for a market with 5 sellers and 5 buyers, the timestep is 1/10 of a second).\n",

It initially creates limit orders for all traders that will be given to them in the future (remember traders are resupplied with orders based on a schedule with an interval). If it already created the orders, on future calls it checks which of those orders should be issued (based on the current time) to the traders and sends them by calling the \"add_order\" method of that trader.\n",

This method either returns a \"transaction_record\" indicating that the order was executed and resulted in a trade or None indicating that the order was not executed (i.e. just added to the LOB). The transaction record contains all information of a trade (time, price, involved parties etc). If the order resulted to a trade, the two traders involved are also notified using their \"bookkeep\" methods.\n",
